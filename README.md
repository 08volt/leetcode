## Introduction

LeetCode is an excellent platform for practicing coding problems, improving problem-solving skills, and preparing for technical interviews. This repository serves as a record of my solutions to various LeetCode problems, providing insights into different approaches and techniques.

Feel free to explore the solutions, provide feedback, or use them as a reference for your own learning journey.

## How to Navigate the Repository

The repository is organized by LeetCode problem number. Each problem has its own directory, named according to the problem's title or number. Within each directory, you'll find the Rust source code file (.rs) containing the solution, along with any necessary explanations or comments.

## Rust Programming Language

[**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a powerful and modern programming language renowned for its emphasis on performance, reliability, and safety. If you are new to Rust, you can find extensive resources and documentation on the official [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### Getting Started with Rust

1. Install Rust by following the instructions on the [official Rust installation page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. Once Rust is installed, you can create a new Rust project or build upon existing ones. Leverage Rust's package manager, **Cargo**, to streamline project management and dependency handling.

   ```bash
   # Create a new Rust project
   cargo new my_project

   # Navigate to the project directory
   cd my_project

   # Build and run the project
   cargo run
   ```
